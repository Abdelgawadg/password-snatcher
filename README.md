# password-snatcher
Program is a proof of concept and is not to be used for any illegal/unethical uses.
Works on windows and is runs very fast (less than or around 5 sec).
The way windows stores the passwords is through an encryption based on the user's sign in credentials. 
It also is put through an utf-8n encryption. 
Both of those can be decrypted as long as the user is signed in to windows.
 
 Still needs a bit of testing.
